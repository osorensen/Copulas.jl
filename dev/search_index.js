While it is still well maintained and regularly updated, the R package copula is a mixture of obscure, heavily optimized C code and more standard R code, which makes it a complicated code base for readability, extensibility, reliability and maintenance.\n\nThis is an attempt to provide a very light, fast, reliable and maintainable copula implementation in native Julia (which means, in particular, floating point type agnostic, i.e. compatibility with BigFloat, DoubleFloats, MultiFloats and other kind of numbers). The two most important exported types are: \n\nCopula: an abstract mother type for all the copulas in the package. \nSklarDist:  allows construction of a multivariate distribution by specifying the copula and the marginals through Sklar's theorem. \n\nWhat is already implemented\n\nThe API contains random number generation, cdf and pdf evaluation, and the fit function from Distributions.jl. A typical use case might look like this: \n\nusing Copulas, Distributions, Random\nX₁ = Gamma(2,3)\nX₂ = Pareto()\nX₃ = LogNormal(0,1)\nC = ClaytonCopula(3,0.7) # A 3-variate Frank Copula with θ = 0.7\nD = SklarDist(C,(X₁,X₂,X₃)) # The final distribution\n\n# This generates a (3,1000)-sized dataset from the multivariate distribution D\nsimu = rand(D,1000)\n\n# While the following estimates the parameters of the model from a dataset: \nD̂ = fit(SklarDist{FrankCopula,Tuple{Gamma,Normal,LogNormal}}, simu)\n# Increase the number of observations to get a beter fit (or not?)  \n\nAvailable copula families are:\n\nGaussianCopula,\nTCopula,\nArchimedeanCopula (for any generator),\nClaytonCopula,FrankCopula, AMHCopula, JoeCopula, GumbelCopula as example of the ArchimedeanCopula abstract type, see below,\nWCopula and MCopula, which are Fréchet-Hoeffding bounds,\nEmpiricalCopula to follow closely a given dataset.\n\nThe next ones to be implemented will probably be: \n\nNested archimedeans (general, with the possibility to nest any family with any family, assuming it is possible, with parameter checks.)\nBernstein copula and more general Beta copula as smoothing of the Empirical copula. \nCheckerboardCopula (and more generally PatchworkCopula)\n\nAdding a new ArchimedeanCopula is very easy. The Clayton implementation is as short as: \n\nstruct ClaytonCopula{d,T} <: ArchimedeanCopula{d}\n    θ::T\nend\nClaytonCopula(d,θ)            = ClaytonCopula{d,typeof(θ)}(θ)     # Constructor\nϕ(C::ClaytonCopula, t)        = (1+sign(C.θ)*t)^(-1/C.θ)          # Generator\nϕ⁻¹(C::ClaytonCopula,t)       = sign(C.θ)*(t^(-C.θ)-1)            # Inverse Generator\nτ(C::ClaytonCopula)           = C.θ/(C.θ+2)                       # θ -> τ\nτ⁻¹(::Type{ClaytonCopula},τ)  = 2τ/(1-τ)                          # τ -> θ\nradial_dist(C::ClaytonCopula) = Distributions.Gamma(1/C.θ,1)      # Radial distribution\n\nThe Archimedean API is modular: \n\nTo sample an archimedean, only radial_dist and ϕ are needed.\nTo evaluate the cdf and (log-)density in any dimension, only ϕ and ϕ⁻¹ are needed.\nCurrently, to fit the copula τ⁻¹ is needed as we use the inverse tau moment method. But we plan on also implementing inverse rho and MLE (density needed). \nNote that the generator ϕ follows the convention ϕ(0)=1, while others (e.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula(probabilitytheory)#Archimedean_copulas) use ϕ⁻¹ as the generator.\nWe plan on implementing the Williamson transformations so that radial-dist can be automaticlaly deduced from ϕ and vice versa, if you dont know much about your archimedean family\n\nDev Roadmap\n\nUrgent things\n\n[ ] Add tests and documentation\n\nNext\n\n[ ] Extensive documentation and tests for the current implementation. \n[x] Implement archimedean density generally. \n[ ] Docs: show how to implement another archimedean.  \n[ ] Give the user the choice of fitting method via fit(dist,data; method=\"MLE\") or fit(dist,data; method=\"itau\") or fit(dist,data; method=\"irho\").\n[ ] Fitting a generic archimedean : should provide an empirical generator\n[ ] Make Archimedean more generic : inputing only radial_dist or only phi shoudl be enough to get pdf, cdf, rand, tau, rho, itau, irho, fit, radial_dist, etc...  Williamson d-transform and inverse d-transform should be implemented. The checking of nesting possibility should be done automatically with some rules (is phi_inv \\circ phi complementely monotonous ? with obviously shortcut for inter-family nestings.)   \n\nMaybe later\n\n[ ] Vines?\n[ ] NestedArchimedean and very easy implementation of new archimeean copulas via the radial dist or the phi/invphi + Williamson transform. \n[ ] BernsteinCopula and BetaCopula could also be implemented. \n[ ] PatchworkCopula and CheckerboardCopula: could be nice things to have :)\n[ ] Goodness of fits tests ?\n\nContributions are welcome\n\nDo not hesitate to open an issue to discuss :)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"#Copulas.EmpiricalCopula","page":"Home","title":"Copulas.EmpiricalCopula","text":"EmpiricalCopula{d,MT}\n\nFields:\n\nu::MT - the matrix of observations. \n\nConstructor\n\nEmpiricalCopula(u;pseudos=true)\n\nThe EmpiricalCopula in dimension d is parameterized by a pseudo-data matrix wich should have shape (d,N).
